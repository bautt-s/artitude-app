<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Artitude is an online art gallery where the user can find and learn about artists, who they are and what inspired them to make such beautiful works of art, which can be also be visualized and get info about. Users may also submit another artist or piece.

This project was born with the intention of learning what were new technologies for me: Next.js and GraphQL, as well as mastering TypeScript in a full-stack project.
